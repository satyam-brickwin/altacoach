# Chat Analysis Feature

This feature allows administrators to anonymously view and analyze user AI chat conversations to gain insights into how users are interacting with the AI assistant.

## Features

- View a list of all chat conversations
- Filter conversations by date range and search terms
- View detailed conversation content
- See analytics on chat usage, including:
  - Total conversations
  - Total messages
  - Active users
  - Average messages per conversation
  - Popular topics

## Implementation Details

The chat analysis feature uses Supabase as the backend database to store and retrieve chat conversations. The main components are:

1. **Conversations List**: Displays all chat conversations with pagination
2. **Conversation Details**: Shows the full conversation between the user and AI
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Provides high-level metrics on chat usage

## Privacy Considerations

- User identifiers are partially masked to maintain privacy
- The feature is only accessible to administrators
- No personal data beyond what's necessary for analysis is displayed

## Future Enhancements

- Add sentiment analysis for conversations
- Implement topic clustering to better categorize conversations
- Add export functionality for reports
- Integrate with the main analytics dashboard
